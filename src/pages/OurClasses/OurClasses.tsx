                We at The Grove believe exposing children to music helps them to learn sounds mean words and words have meaning. Music supports all areas of
                child development including intellectual, social-emotional, motor, language and overall literacy. It helps the body and mind work together and
                is a vital part of children’s learning at The Grove.

                problem-solving, critical- thinking and listening skills, it can improve memory and concentration and the ability to multi-task. Research has
                shown children proficient in other languages also show signs of enhanced creativity and mental flexibility. Pre-school children learn

                children’s listening skills. They take the children form basic greetings to real life situations through role play. All teachers are French

                Our Spanish classes are taught by an ex-parent of The Grove, Maria. As like the French classes all lessons are fun and engaging. Children learn
                through flash cards, games, songs and repetition. The teacher takes time to ensure the children are comfortable and understand the lesson before
                she moves on. Children can often be heard singing Spanish or French songs throughout the day without any prompting and are always excited to
                tell their parents what new things they have learnt.

                participation and social skills, such as sharing. With the use of nursery rhymes, colourful books and props provides the children with

                poses and stretches used help with digestion, relieve gas, colic and constipation. Yoga also helps with co- ordination and strengthens their

                for the babies.

                Once the children graduate to the toddler group their class starts with dancing and singing to yoga songs and nursery rhymes that are familiar
                to them. Through a planned theme such as transport, gardens, visiting a farm or going to the jungle the children use yoga poses to act out the
                story. We use familiar pictures to show the children what pose is required such as a gorilla, cat or dog, butterfly or frog. Breathing
                techniques are also incorporated into the class, such as hissing like a snake. Brain Gym games are also incorporated in these classes.

                Physical education is paramount to the child’s wellbeing and development. At The Grove we provide the children with daily physical activities
                and weekly Sport school sessions. During the classes the children learn to negotiate space and obstacles safely, with consideration for
                themselves and others; They demonstrate strength, balance and coordination when playing; they move energetically, such as running, jumping,
                dancing, hopping, skipping and climbing.

                The Sport school sessions cover all areas of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS). The classes are carefully planned to support the
                children’s attention and listening skills, these are developed through listening to and carrying out instructions from the teacher. The children
                are encouraged to ask and answer questions about the equipment and how to use it. Their confidence is developed, they show self-confidence in
                expressing to their peers and teacher if they are finding the task at hand easy or difficult or explaining how they are going to carry out the
                activity.

                The children are taught to control their feelings and emotions when things don’t go the way they want them to go i.e. not having the desired
                coloured ball or want to be first to try out the activity. They are encouraged to listen to their peers opinions and that not everyone is the
                same they know that other children have different likes and dislikes and they may be good at different things not everyone is good at the same
                thing. The children gain in confidence when working together; they learn to share and take turns and listen to each other and work together to
                problem solve.

                The children help the teacher to set up the equipment and count as they do so. They learn the names of the different shapes of the equipment and
                measure distance between cones or hurdles. The children learn to manoeuvre around cones hop and jump over hurdles and standing poles. They are
                also able to use equipment such as racquets and bats (as well as their hands and feet) to control a balls movement.
